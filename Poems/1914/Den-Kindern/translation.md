You know nothing of time,  
You know only that, somewhere in the distance,  
A war is being fought,  
You whittle your wood into sword and shield and spear  
And play your game blissfully in the garden,  
Set up tents,  
Carry white bandages marked with the red cross.  
So war will remain  
For you, always, only a dim legend,  
So you will never stand in the field  
And never die  
And never rush out of a house crumbling in fire.  

Nevertheless, you will be soldiers one day  
And one day you will know  
That the sweet breath of this life,  
The precious possession of the heartbeat,  
Is only a loan, and that whatever was lost  
In the past, and the heir you long for,  
And the farthest future,  
Rolls through your blood,  
And that for every hair on your head  
Somebody endured one struggle, one pain, one death.  
And you shall know that whatever is noble  
In your soul is always a warrior,  
Even though he beats no weapons,  
That every day a struggle and a destiny is waiting.  
Do not forget this!  
Think of the blood, the shambles, the ruin  
On which your own future reposes,  
And how, even more, upon death and sacrifice is builded  
The tiniest happiness  

Then your life will flame out more  
And one day gather even death into its arms.

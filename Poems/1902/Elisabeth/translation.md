I should tell you a story,  
The night is already so late--  
Do you want to torment me,  
Lovely Elizabeth?  

I write poems about that,  
Just as you do;  
And the entire history of my love  
Is you and this evening.  

You mustn't be troublesome,  
And blow these poems away.  
Soon you will listen to them,  
Listen, and not understand.

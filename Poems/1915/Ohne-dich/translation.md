My pillow gazes upon me at night  
Empty as a gravestone;  
I never thought it would be so bitter  
To be alone,  
Not to lie down asleep in your hair.  

I lie alone in a silent house,  
The hanging lamp darkened,  
And gently stretch out my hands  
To gather in yours,  
And softly press my warm mouth  
Toward you, and kiss myself, exhausted and weak--  
Then suddenly I'm awake  
And all around me the cold night grows still.  
The star in the window shines clearly--  
Where is your blond hair,  
Where your sweet mouth?  

Now I drink pain in every delight  
And poison in every wine;  
I never knew it would be so bitter  
To be alone,  
Alone, without you.

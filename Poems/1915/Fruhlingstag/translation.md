Wind in bushes and bird piping  
And high in the highest fresh blue  
A haughty cloud ship, becalmed...  
I dream of a blond woman,  
I dream of my youth,  
The high heaven blue and outspread  
Is the cradle of my longing  
Where I choose to lie calm  
And blessedly warm  
With the soft humming,  
Just like a child held  
On his mother's arm.

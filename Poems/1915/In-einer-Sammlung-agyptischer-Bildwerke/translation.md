Out of jeweled eyes  
Silent and eternal, you gaze away  
Over us late brothers.  
Neither love nor longing appears to be known among  
Your smooth gleaming procession.  
Once, inconceivable, you walked, majestic  
Brothers and sisters of constellations,  
Among the temples.  
Even today, holiness like the distant fragrance of gods  
Drafts round your brows,  
Dignity round your knees:  
Your beauty breathes calmly,  
Your home is eternity.  

But we, your younger brothers,  
Stagger godless through a confusing life,  
Our trembling souls stand eagerly, opened,  
To all the sufferings of passion,  
To every burning desire.  
Our goal is death,  
Our belief a belief in what perishes,  
No great distance of time defines  
Our fleeting faces.  
Nevertheless, we also  
Bear, burned into our very souls,  
The sign of a secret affinity to the spirit,  
We have a foreboding of gods, a feeling for you,  
Images of the silent past,  
A fearless love. Look:  
We hate nothing that exists, not even death,  
Suffering and dying  
Does not horrify our souls,  
As long as we learn more deeply to love.  
Our heart is the bird's heart,  
And it belongs to the sea and the forest, and we name  
Slaves and wretches our brothers,  
We still name with loving names both animal and stone.  
So also the images  
Of our perishing lives will not survive us  
In hard stone:  
They will vanish smiling,  
And in the flickering dust of sunlight  
Every hour to new joys and unhappiness,  
Impatient, eternal, they will rise.

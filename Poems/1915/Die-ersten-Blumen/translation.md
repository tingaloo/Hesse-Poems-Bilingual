Beside the brook  
Toward the willows,  
During these days  
So many yellow flowers have opened  
Their eyes into gold.  
I have long since lost my innocence, yet a memory  
Touches my depth, the golden hours of morning,  
An gazes brilliantly upon me out of the eyes of flowers.  
I was going to pick flowers;  
Now I leave them all standing  
And walk home, an old man.

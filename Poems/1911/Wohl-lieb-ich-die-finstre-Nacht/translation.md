I like the dark night well enough;  
But sometimes, when it turns bleak  
And peaked, as my suffering laughs at me,  
In dreadful kingdom horrifies me,  
And I wish to God I could take one look at the sunlight  
And the blue of heaven brought back to light by its clouds,  
And I want to lie down warm in the wide spaces of the day.  
Then I can dream of the night.

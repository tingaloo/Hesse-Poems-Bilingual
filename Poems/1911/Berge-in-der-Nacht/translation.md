The lake has died down,  
The reed, black in its sleep,  
Whispers in a dream.  
Expanding immensely into the coutnryside,  
The mountains loom, outspread.  
They are not resting.  
They breathe deeply, and hold themselves,  
Pressed tightly, to one another.  
Deeply breathing,  
Laden with mute forces,  
Caught in a wasting passion.

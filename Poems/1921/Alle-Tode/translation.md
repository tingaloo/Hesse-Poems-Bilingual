I have already died all deaths,  
And I am going to die all deaths again,  
Die the death of the wood in the tree,  
Die the stone death in the mountain,  
Earth death in the sand,  
Leaf death in the crackling summer grass
And the poor bloody human death.  

I will be born again, flowers,  
Tree and grass I will be born again,  
Fish and deer, bird and butterfly.  
And out of every form,  
Longing will drag me up the stairways  
To the last suffering,  
Up to the suffering of men.  

O quivering tensed bow,  
When the raging fist of longing  
Commands both poles of life  
To bend to each other!  
Yet often, and many times over,  
You will hunt me down from death to birth  
On the painful track of the creations,  
The glorious track of the creations.

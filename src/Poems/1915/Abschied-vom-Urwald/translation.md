With my suitcase, I sit on the beach;  
Below me, on the steamer, Indians,  
Chinese, Malays are shouting,  
Laughing loudly and trading their knickknacks.  

Behind me, feverish nights, and days  
Of glowing life, that even now I carry  
Carefully as treasures in my deepest thoughts,  
As though I still wet my feet in the jungle stream.  

I know many countries and cities are still waiting,  
But never again will the night of the forests,  
The wild fermenting garden of the earliest world  
Lure me in, and horrify me with its magnificence.  

Here in this endless and gleaming wilderness  
I was removed farther than ever from the world of men--  
And I never saw so close and so clearly  
The image in the mirror of my own soul.

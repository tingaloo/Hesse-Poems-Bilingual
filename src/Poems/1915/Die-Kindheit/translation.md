My farthest valley, you are  
Bewitched and vanished.  
Many times, in my grief and agony,  
You have beckoned upward to me from your country of shadows  
And opened your legendary eyes  
Till I, lost in a quick illusion, Lost myself back to your wholly.  

O dark gate,  
O dark hour of death,  
Come forth,  
So I can recover from this life's emptiness  
And go home to my own dreams.

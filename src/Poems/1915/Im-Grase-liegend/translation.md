In this everything now, the quick delusions of flowers,  
And the down colors of the bright summer meadow,  
The soft blue spread of heaven, the bees' song,  
Is this everything only a god's  
Groaning dream,  
The cry of unconscious powers for deliverance?  
The distant line of the mountain,  
That beautifully and courageously rests in the blue,  
Is this too only a convulsion,  
Only the wild strain of fermenting nature,  
Only grief, only agony, only meaningless fumbling,  
Never resting, never a blessed movement?  
No! Leave me alone, you impure dream  
Of the world in suffering!  
The dance of tiny insects cradles you in an evening radiance,  
The bird's cry cradles you,  
A breath of wind cools my forehead  
With consolation.  
Leave me alone, you unendurably old human grief!  
Let it all be pain,  
Let it all be suffering, let it be wretched--  
But not this one sweet hour in the summer,  
And not the fragrance of the red clover,  
And not the deep tender pleasure  
In my soul.

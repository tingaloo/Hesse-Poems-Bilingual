I walk so often, late, along the streets,  
Lower my gaze, and hurry, full of dread,  
Suddenly, silently, you still might rise  
And I would have to gaze on all your grief  
With my own eyes,  
While you demand your happiness, that's dead.  

I know, you walk beyond me, every night,  
With a coy football, in a wretched dress  
And walk for money, looking miserable!  
Your shoes gather God knows what ugly mess,  
The wind plays in your hair with lewd delight--  
You walk, and walk, and find no home at all.

Friend of my young manhood, on many an evening  
I return gracefully to you, when in the elder bushes  
Of the garden fallen asleep  
Only the rustling fountains still make a sound.  

Nobody knows you, my friend; this new age has driven  
Far away from the silent magic of Greece.  
Without prayer, and cheater out of gods,  
People troll reasonably in the dust.  

But to the secret gathering who sink in their inner lives,  
Whose souls God has stricken with longing,  
The heavenly strings of your songs  
Are singing, even today.  

We turn passionately, exhausted by day,  
To the ambrosia, the night of your music,  
Whose fanning wings casts us into  
A shadow of golden dream.  

Yes, and luminously, when your song delights us,  
Sorrowfully burning for the blessed land of the past,  
For the temples of the Greeks,  
Our homesickness lasts forever.

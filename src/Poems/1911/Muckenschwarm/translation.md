Many thousand glittering motes  
Crowd forward greedily together  
In trembling circles.  
Extravagantly carousing away  
For a whole hour rapidly vanishing,  
They rave delirious, a shrill whir,  
Shivering with joy against death.  

Whole kingdoms, sunk into ruin,  
Whose thrones, heavy with gold, instantly scattered  
Into night and legend, without leaving a trace,  
Have never known of so fierce a dancing.

Flowers, too, suffer death,  
And yet they are guiltless.  
So, too, our own being is pure  
And suffers only grief,  
Where we ourselves do not wish to understand.  
What we call guilt  
Is absorbed by the sun,  
It comes to meet us out of the pure throats  
Of flowers, fragrance and the moving gaze of children.  
And as flowers die,  
So we die, too,  
Only the death of deliverance,  
Only the death of rebirth.

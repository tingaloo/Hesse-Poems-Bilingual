Now we are silent  
And sing no songs any more,  
Our pace grows heavy;  
This is the night, that was bound to come.  

Give me your hand,  
Perhaps we still have a long way to go.  
It's snowing, it's snowing.  
Winter is a hard thing in a strange country.  

Where is the time  
When a light, a hearth burned for us?  
Give me your hand!  
Perhaps we still have a long way to go.

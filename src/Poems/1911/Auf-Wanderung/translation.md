Don't be downcast, soon the night will come,  
When we can see the cool moon laughing in secret  
Over the faint country side,  
And we rest, hand in hand.  

Don't b e downcast, the time will soon come  
When we can have rest. Our small crosses will stand  
On the bright edge of the road together,  
And rain fall, and snow fall,  
And the wings come and go.

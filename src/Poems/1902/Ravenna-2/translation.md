The women of Ravenna,  
With their deep gazes and affectionate gestures,  
Carry a knowledge of the days  
Of the old city, their Feste.  

The women of Ravenna  
Weep like children who won't tell you: deep, light.  
And when they laugh, a glittering song  
Rises in the sludge of the text.  

The women of Ravenna pray  
Like children: gentle, fully contented.  
They can speak love's words without even knowing  
Themselves they are lying.  

The women of Ravenna kiss  
Rarely and deep, they kiss back.  
And all they know about life is that  
We all have to die.

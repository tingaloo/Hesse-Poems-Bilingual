I, too, have been in Ravenna.  
It is a little dead city  
That has churches and a good many ruins.  
You can read about it in books.  

You walk back through it and look around you:  
The streets are so muddy and damp, and so  
Dumbstruck for a thousand years,  
And moss and grass, everywhere.

That is what old songs are like--  
You listen to them, and nobody laughs  
And everybody draws back into  
His own time till night falls into him.
